a) Advantages of using spring boot over spring are :-

	i) 	Spring boot allows to write shrot length of codes as compared to spring.
 	ii)	Spring boot makes it easy to develop stand-alone applications with less configuration.
	iii)	Spring boot is primaraily famous for Autoconfiguration. It automatically configures the classes based on 		the requirements. As compared to Spring which uses dependency injection.
	iv) 	Spring Boot offers preinstalled or embedded server for example Tomcat server.
	v)	There are several plugins available for Spring Boot that offers extra functionality.

	Above written points are some advantages of Spring Boot over spring.

b) Explain types of Bean Scopes and Explain any two of them.
	
	The life span of an object of Spring bean is known as its Bean Scope.
	
	Spring framework has 4 scopes of a bean object:
	1) Singelton scope  2) prototype scope  3) request scope  4) session scope

	
	i) Singleton scope :-
		
		singleton scope returns the same object for all the getBean() method calling with the same bean id.
		
		for exmple: 
		
		Student s1 = ctx.getBean("s1", Student.class;
		Student s2 = ctx.getBean("s1", Student.class);
		
		System.out.println(s1 == s2); // output is true



	ii) Prototype scope  :-
		
		it retunrs a seperate bean object each time we call getBean() method even if we provide same id also.
		
		for exmple: 
		
		Student s1 = ctx.getBean("s1", Student.class;
		Student s2 = ctx.getBean("s1", Student.class);
		
		System.out.println(s1 == s2); // output is false
