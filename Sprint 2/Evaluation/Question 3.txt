1) SOAP- based webservices :-
	
	SOAP ( simple object access protocol ) is an XML based protocol. it is used to communicate between the client application and the server application.
	
	Since, it is XML based, it is both platform and language indepenent.
	
	for example :-
	
	<employee>
	<empId> 111 </empId>
	<name> Ratan </name>
	<age> 42 </age>
	<adrress> Delhi </address>
	</employee>
	
	SOAP is generally heavyweight when it comes to creating a web service since it requires some extra classes to parse the  XML files and convert them into 		Objects and vice-versa.


2) Restful Web services :-
	
	Since SOAP is heavyweight and its also costly in operations, we need something else to make things lighter, that is where REST (Representational State 		transfer) comes into play.
	
	REST architecture is light-weight as compared to SOAP since it creates the web servies and exposed them through HTTP protocol. Also it doesn't need any 		extra classes to parse XML files.
	
	We can build restful web services with both XML  and JSON.
	Although JSON is used worldwide and it is more popular as well.
