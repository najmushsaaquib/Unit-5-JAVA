a) Explain the ACID properties.
			 ACID
               A=> Atomicity;
               C=> Consistency
               I=> Isolation
	       D=> Durability
    
Atomicity :> It can be defined as process in which entire transaction takes place in one go Or does not happen at all;

Consistancy : This means if the data was in a consistent state before a transaction, then it must be in the consistent state after performing any transaction.

Isolation : It means multiple Transaction can occur independentaly without disturbing one another.

Durability : After completion of every  transaction, all the changes made during the transaction must be stored in a permanent systme somewhere so that we can retrieve it anytime we need.

Example : There are two People A and B
	
A account balance - (5000)
B account balance - (3500)	
Total Balance = 8500

Transfer amount of 500 from B to A
Transaction stars here -
check if the both Accounts are active
check if both have sufficient fund to complete the transaction

B balance - 500
A balance  +500

End of transaction;

Amount in A account = 6000
Amount in B account = 3000



B)  Disadvantages of indexing ---
	
While creating a index for a column in order to refine your search queries, it also takes extra space in the memory.
Also, when we modify our database or fire any query which requries that the Data should be deleted
	or new data shoudl be enterd. These queries are very expensive since indexing is done,
	and data is being shifted from one place to another in order to maintain the indexing. Hence creating a expenisive query
